===========================================
GSA uses the following version number scheme: X.Y.Z (ex: 3.7.2)
X - Increments following significant code rewrites or major spell library updates. This usually happens with a new expansion.
Y - Increments with any significant code rewrite that includes major bug fixes or features, or any update that adds new sound files.
Z - Increments with any update that does not follow the above, such as minor bug fixes, new spells using sounds already in the library, etc.
If you maintain forks or translations of GSA2, any X or Y increment may require your attention.

Note: I do NOT support ANY version of GSA2 outside of the latest Retail/BCC Live or PTR/Beta versions.
Please do not ask me for help with Vanilla Classic or private server versions. I will not help you.

I wanted to take a quick moment to thank you all for your support since I took over GSA way back at the beginning
of Legion! Your continued feedback, bug reports, and use of the mod has kept me motivated to keep up with it through
WoW's ups and downs. I sincerely hope that this mod has provided an accessibility boost to capable players who just
needed a little more to keep up with the ebb and flow of PvP combat, and that your ratings continue to climb.

Per the request of some users, I have added a completely optional donation button on the project's CurseForge page.
Please feel no pressure to chip in; and don't worry, no mention of it will ever be found in-game.
