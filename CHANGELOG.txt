Priest
- Added Phase Shift to Aura Applied ("Greater Fade")

===========================================
- version 4.4 (Dragonflight)

Quick update per someone's comment. As a note, it is SUPER helpful if you want something updated in the addon to provide 
spell names and/or Spell IDs that are not functioning as expected. If you can save me from having to do homework on class 
changes, I will try to push out updates to the spell library. Thanks!

Mage
- Fixed incorrect spell ID for Polymorph: Duck.

Priest
- Added Ultimate Penitence to Cast Start.
- Added Penance to Cast Start (off by default).
- Removed Light's Wrath.

===========================================
- version 4.3 (Dragonflight)

IMPORTANT NOTICE
While I still am supporting GSA2, my time (and desire) to do so has been greatly diminishing over recent months. I can no longer commit to supporting Classic variants of this
addon, and will only do so in the form of quick code fixes that I am also making no attempt to test or validate. I only officially support Retail.

GSA2 is built upon a codebase that was not originally mine, and iterated on before I had a solid grasp of programming and lua scripting concepts over 6 or so years. While I have come a long way,
maintaining this spaghetti-code filled addon is not a trivial amount of work especially given how many different places I need to manually update simple data changes.

Long-term I have a hope that I can sit down and rewrite GSA from the ground up with more features, a more cohesive spell library, and just fewer bugs. Whether I will ever
actually do that remains to be seen, but is honestly quite unlikely unless I suddenly get really into writing WoW addons. There are simply other, bigger, more exciting projects
I would rather spend programming time on than maintaining a troublesome addon for free - especially one that fulfills its purpose just fine even if there are some rough edges.

Thank you all for your understanding. To reiterate: Retail is still supported, updates are just slower.


Addon
- Posting an update for 10.1.5 one day before 10.1.7. What could go wrong?
- Disabled alerts in Time Rifts.
- Lazy spaghetti attempt to disable alerts out in the world if you are not personally PvP flagged. If this causes problems, delete line 414 in GladiatorlosSA.lua.
