===========================================
- version TWWB1 (The War Within)

First The War Within update.

NOTE: Spell database is not yet updated to reflect changes in 11.0 onward.

General
- Fixed a bug that caused the addon to destroy itself when entering a new expansion. Haha oops.
- Fixed lua errors that result from hovering over spells in the options panel.
- (Hopefully) temporarily disabled chat shortcuts (/gsa and similar) to the options menu because it is broken and I don't know why.
