===========================================
GSA uses the following version number scheme: X.Y.Z (ex: 3.7.2)
X - Increments following significant code rewrites or major spell library updates. This usually happens with a new expansion.
Y - Increments with any significant code rewrite that includes major bug fixes or features, or any update that adds new sound files.
Z - Increments with any update that does not follow the above, such as minor bug fixes, new spells using sounds already in the library, etc.
If you maintain forks or translations of GSA2, any X or Y increment may require your attention.

Note: I do NOT support ANY version of GSA2 outside of the latest Retail Live and BETA/PTR versions of the addon.
I do not currently support Classic.
I am currently working on support for Burning Crusade Classic.
I will never support older versions for Private Servers.
Please stop asking. I will not help you.

General
* Alerts no longer play in sanctuaries.

===========================================
- version TBC-1.0 (2.5.1)

NOTE: GSA2 for TBC is designed with Spell Ranks in mind. ALL spell ranks are included on most spells, excluding
lower ranks specific abilities that don't get an alert-worthy secondary effect (like CC) until the later ranks.

If you are observant enough to notice a spell that might be missing a few ranks, please let me know.

General
* Added and corrected sound alerts for all intended spells.
* Tweaked option tooltips to more appropriately reflect classes represented in TBC.
