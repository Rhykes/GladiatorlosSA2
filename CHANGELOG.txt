===========================================
- version 3.1 (9.0)

I wanted to take a quick moment to thank you all for your support since I took over GSA way back at the beginning
of Legion! Your continued feedback, bug reports, and use of the mod has kept me motivated to keep up with it through
WoW's ups and downs. I sincerely hope that this mod has provided an accessibility boost to capable players who just
needed a little more to keep up with the ebb and flow of PvP combat, and that your ratings continue to climb.

Per the request of some users, I have added a completely optional donation button on the project's CurseForge page.
Please feel no pressure to chip in; and don't worry, no mention of it will ever be found in-game.
